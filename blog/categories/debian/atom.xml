    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Kit project in Golang is the common project containing all the standard libraries or packages used across all the Go projects in the organization.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>I attended <a href="http://www.gophercon.in/">GopherCon India</a> 2017, there was a talk on “Package Oriented Design In Go” by <a href="https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet">William Kennedy</a>. In that talk, William explained some really important and thoughtful design principles which We can apply in our day to day life, while writing Go. Hence, I wanted to apply these design philosophies to the Golang projects in which I have been working on as a part of <a href="https://github.com/openebs">OpenEBS</a> project. I learnt a good practice of having a Golang Kit project at the organization level from William’s talk.</p>

<h2>What is the Kit Project?</h2>

<p>The Kit project in Golang is the common project containing all the standard libraries or packages used across all the Go projects in the organization. Packages in the Kit project should follow design philosophies.</p>

<h2>Need for a Kit project</h2>

<p>Sometimes, We write same Golang packages again and again to do the same task at different levels in the different Golang projects under the same organization. For example, we write custom logger package in the different Golang projects. If the custom logger package is same across the organization and can be reused by simply importing it, then this custom logger package is the perfect fit for Kit project.
You can sense how much time and cost it will save for us when we have a Kit project.</p>

<h2>How to convert existing projects to have “kit”</h2>

<p>   Maya is the kit project in the progress.
   I will walk through our journey of creating a Kit project called maya for OpenEBS organization from existing Go projects. At <a href="https://github.com/openebs">OpenEBS</a>, as a open source and growing Golang project, We value Golang principles and We try hard to leverage Golang&rsquo;s offerings. Maya is the Kit project for the Application projects like <a href="https://github.com/openebs/mayaserver">maya-apiserver</a>, maya-storage-bot etc. Maya contains all the kubernetes &amp; nomad API’s, common utilities etc. needed for development of maya-apiserver and maya-storage-bot. In the near future, we are trying to push our custom libraries to maya. So that, it will become a promising Golang kit project for OpenEBS community.</p>

<p>We have specifically followed the package oriented design principles in Golang to create maya as a kit project.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Usability</h3>

  We moved common packages such as orchprovider, types, pkg to maya from maya-apiserver. These packages are very generic and can be used in most of the Golang projects in OpenEBS organization. Brief details about new packages in Maya.

<ul>
<li><p>Orchprovider : <code>orchprovider</code> contains packages of different orchestrators such as kubernetes and nomad.</p></li>
<li><p>types: <code>types</code> provides all the generic types related to orchestrator.</p></li>
<li><p>pkg: <code>pkg</code> contains packages like nethelper, util etc.</p></li>
<li><p>volumes: <code>volumes</code> contain packages related to volume provisioner and profiles.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>  Packages in the Kit project should be purposeful. These packages must provide, not contain. In maya, we have packages like types, orchprovider, volumes etc. name of these packages suggests the functionality provided by them.</p></li>
<li><h3>Portability</h3>

<p>  Portability is important factor for packages in kit project. Hence, we are making maya in such a way that it will be easy to import and use in any Golang project. Packages in the Maya are not single point of dependency and all the packages are independent of each other.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Example usage of maya kit project in maya-apiserver</h2>

<p>Maya-apiserver uses maya as a Kit project. Maya-apiserver exposes OpenEBS operations in form of REST APIs. This allows multiple clients e.g. volume related plugins to consume OpenEBS storage operations exposed by Maya API server.</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Need for orchestration providers in maya-apiserver</h3>

<p>  Maya-apiserver has been designed keeping storage inside containers in mind. In other words, containerized storage. This leads to maya-apiserver using best of breed container orchestrators. Hence maya-apiserver abstracts the container related orchestration needs in form of orchprovider namespace. Therefore,to achieve above need maya-api server uses orchprovider package provided by Maya.</p></li>
<li><h3>Need for volumes in the maya-apiserver</h3>

<p>  There can be multiple persistent volume provisioners e.g. jiva &amp; cstor which has the details of workings of its volume. maya-apiserver tries to abstract these into volumes operations whose specifics will reside in individual namespaces i.e. jiva, cstor, etc. Hence, maya-apiserver will make use of volumes package from Maya to satisfy above requirements.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>  Golang Kit project should contain packages which are usable, purposeful and portable. Golang Kit projects will improve the efficiency of the organization at both human and code level.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a brief report on my last week work with Debian Reproducible Builds.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In week 4, I mostly worked on designing an interfaces and tackling different issues related to argument completion feature of diffoscope and in week 5 I worked on adding hiding .buildinfo from .changes files.</p>

<h3>Update for last week&rsquo;s activities</h3>

<ul>
<li>I researched different diffoscope outputs. In <a href="https://tests.reproducible-builds.org/debian/reproducible.html">reproducible-builds testing framework </a> only differences of <code>.buildinfo</code> files are given but I needed diffoscope outputs for <code>.changes</code> files. Hence, I had to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/Howto">build packages locally</a> using <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/ExperimentalToolchain">our experimental tool chain</a>. My goal was to generate different outputs and to see how I can hide <code>.buildinfo</code> files from <code>.changes</code>.</li>
<li><p>I updated argument completion patch as per suggestions given by Paul Wise (pabs). Patch has been reviewed by Mattia Rizzolo, Holger Levsen and <a href="https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/commit/?id=d733cb47903c54a3c4a699131e1b7bde3e492bbf">merged</a> by    Reiner Herrmann (deki) into <a href="https://anonscm.debian.org/git/reproducible/diffoscope.git/commit/?id=77dfd8d3e5e2e5d8ba31e606ef36cbd8f2315743">diffoscope master</a>. This patch closes <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=826711">#826711</a>. Thanks all for support.</p></li>
<li><p>For <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification#Ignore_.60.buildinfo.60_files_when_comparing_.60.changes.60_files">Ignore <code>.buildinfo</code> files when comparing <code>.changes</code> files</a>, we finally decided to enable this by default and without having any command line option to hide.</p></li>
<li><p>Last week I researched more on <code>.changes</code> and <code>.buildinfo</code> files. After getting guidelines from Lunar I was able to understand the need of this feature. I am in the middle of implementation of this particular problem.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Goal for upcoming week:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Finish the implementation of <code>hiding .buildinfo from .changes</code></li>
<li>Start thinking on interfaces and discuss about different use cases.</li>
</ul>


<p>I am thankful to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ShirishAgarwal">Shirish Agarwal</a> for helping me through visa process. But, unfortunately I won&rsquo;t get visa till 5th July. So I don&rsquo;t think, I would make it to debconf this year. I will certainly attend Debconf 2017.
Good news for me is I have passed mid-term evaluations of Google Summer of Code 2016. I will continue my work to improve Debian.
Even, I have post GSoC plans ready for Debian project ;)</p>

<p>Have a nice day :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is report on my previous week activities with Debian Reproducible-Builds.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In last 10 days, I had build different Debain packages at my own using prebuilder to experience the reproducibility issues.
I am thankful to deki and Lunar for suggesting me to do that task. Based on this experience, I managed to find more use cases for <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification">&ndash;hide=profiles specification</a>.</p>

<p>I also researched differences of different unreproducible Debian packages on <a href="http://tests.reproducible-builds.org">http://tests.reproducible-builds.org</a> . There are many packages available for examination.</p>

<p>In brief I did following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>I worked on <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification">&ndash;hide=profiles specification</a>. Mostly, I tried to find use cases.</li>
<li>I made changes to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification">https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification</a> added detailed information in each use case.</li>
<li>Read documentation on <code>argcomplete</code> python module and had some hands on experience with module. Purpose of doing this was to add argument completion feature to Diffoscope. pabs had filed bug report for this <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=826711">#826711</a>. I am implementing this feature and discussing issues with pabs as well as researching diffs side-by-side to generate more use cases. Here, Thanks to pabs for guidance and support :)</li>
<li>I went through different software to see how they are ignoring the stuff. Those are following:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/apkdiff/apkdiff.py">apkdiff</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/build-compare">pkg-diff</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git.gag.com/?p=debian/tar;a=tree">tar</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Upcoming week will be an important as well as fun week because I will be implementing the use cases. Right now, I am currently looking at different softwares which ignores stuff and taking <a href="https://gist.github.com/satyamz/77d86e1fc78d104c784c0238a3a7c0e3">notes</a> of it. So that, it will help me during implementing solution of use cases.
I am also looking forward to <a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/reproducible-builds/Week-of-Mon-20160606/005774.html">feedback</a> from community on use cases and CLI interfaces.
Have a great week :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a concise report on my previous week.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I started working from 28 May as the exams ended. This report is bit late. I started work on &ndash;hide=profiles flag.
Till now, I did/doing following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read documentation related to argparse python module.</li>
<li>Debug the code to find the ways to implement the solution</li>
<li>Discussed the problem with the community.</li>
<li>Based on progress I have pushed some code <a href="http://deb.li/ZNDE">here</a> (work is in progress)</li>
</ul>


<p>Lunar suggested me to create the specification for &ndash;hide=profiles.
It can be found here <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification">https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification</a></p>

<p>General purpose of addition of &ndash;hide=profiles to diffoscope is because we want to provide an alternative for tool like <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/build-compare">OBS pkg-diff</a>. We want to increase userbase of diffoscope and thus number of contributors. Hopefully, I will finish this part as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We are still discussing, how things should be done!
Right now, I am researching diff of unreproducible packages and trying to develop use cases. I will update the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/HideProfilesSpecification">HideProfilesSpecification</a> wiki with my findings.
Lunar has given me a proper directions and community is very much helpful. :)</p>

<p>My goal for  an upcoming week is to search for packages which are unreproducible and generate use cases for diffoscope.
This week I will also try to fix the reproducibility of Debian packages.</p>

<p>I am loving, contributing to Debian and free software and it&rsquo;s a great learning experience. Many things to come in upcoming time :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first blog post among series of posts which I will be writing throughout the summer about Google Summer of Code 2016 under Debian Reproducible Builds Experience.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>I am <strong>Satyam Zode</strong> I am a final year Computer Science student (Satyam_z on IRC). I live in Pune, India (GMT +5:30). I am pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="http://pict.edu"><strong>Pune Institute of Computer Technology, Pune</strong></a>. I have been programming for the past 4 years. I am well versed in C/C++, Python3, and Golang. My Alioth and Github handles are <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/users/satyamz-guest/">satyamz-guest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/satyamz">satyamz</a> respectively. I have been using GNU/Linux and free software from last four years. I am an open source enthusiast and I have been following <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html"><strong>Hacker culture</strong></a> since past three years.</p>

<h3>Accepted into Google Summer of Code 2016 under Debian Project:</h3>

<p>I am glad that I have got an opportunity to contribute to the Debian Project via Google Summer of Code 2016. I am accepted for project <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4739621762105344"><strong>Improving diffoscope tool and reproducibility of Debian packages</strong></a>. This Summer and beyond I will be working with Debian Reproducible Builds team to improve the debbugging tool called <a href="https://diffoscope.org"><strong>Diffoscope</strong></a> (previously known as debbindiff).
Thanks a bunch to Debian community, Lunar, Holger Levsen, Reiner Herrmann, Mattia Rizzolo and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds">reproducible-builds</a> folks for giving me this opportunity. Here is my GSoC'16 <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2016/StudentApplications/SatyamZode">Proposal</a>. And Yay! It really feels great.</p>

<h3>Project details:</h3>

<p>I will be working on Diffoscope tool which is debbugging tool developed under <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds"><strong>reproducible-builds</strong></a> effort.
Basically, Diffoscope compares two files and shows the difference in text and html format. Diffoscope is mainly developed to compare two Debian packages which may consist of binary files, tar files, text files etc. Diffoscope helps to identify difference between two Debian packages with respect to timestamps, file ordering etc. Diffoscope will try to get to the bottom of what makes files or directories different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds and transform various binary formats into more human readable form to compare them. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, Debian packages or PDF just as easily.
Diffoscope helps to identify the reproduciblity of Debian packages.
During this summer I will be improving Diffoscope. I will be mainly working on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish Parallel processing part.</li>
<li>Add command line option  - -ignore-profile to allow users to ignore arbitrary differences.</li>
<li>perform fuzzy-matching across archives.</li>
<li>Add new file comparators to extend support of diffoscope for new file types.</li>
</ul>


<p>My next blog post will be regarding community bonding. Thanks for reading :)</p>
